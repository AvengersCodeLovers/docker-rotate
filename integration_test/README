This file contains integration tests for Docker containers. These integration tests need a Docker
instance to run against, and they will use your local container. While the tests do attempt to
clean up after themselves, that does mean:

 - if you don't have a docker instance available, nothing will work.
 - if everything is working correctly, running the tests will "clean up" your local Docker instance,
   equivalent to running "docker-rotate images --keep 5".
 - if things are NOT working correctly, this could remove any number of images or containers from
   your local docker instance.

Ideally, therefore, you'll want to run them in some kind of protected environment, like Vagrant.
